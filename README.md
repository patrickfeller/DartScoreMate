# DartScoreMate_Softwareentwicklung2

**THIS README STILL NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN OUT**: Sections might include Project Description, Explaination of Key Concepts, Links to Frameworks/important packages, ..

We want to build a Dart Score web-app, which measures a dart player's current score in real-time 
and based on the collected score data gives suggestions for the next "moves" of a player in order to get the highest possible score. 

**Key elements:** 
Real-time score data collected via cameras installed on a dart field 
An integrated AI model which calculates best possible moves 
A user interface which displays current score and suggested further throws


**Features of V1:**

Create Users
Track Score
Save Games (SQL/text files)
ChatGPT Integration (Prompt: You are a darts export and answer specific questions related to darts)...
Live-View of Dart Board (static)

**Advanced Features**

Live Video of Dart Board
User-Login
Detect Score from Image
Personalized Shot Recommendations


## Grading

* Requirements / Docker (10)

### remarks
- ❌ no hand-in with just one file 
- ❌ meaningless commit-messages: use standard words (FIX, FEAT, DOCS,...) and effective description
- ✅ good code logic (design patterns, classes, ...)
- ✅ monitor package dependencies (conda + uv/`requirements.txt`)
- ✅ code documentation (docstrings, comments, ...)
- ✅ Unittests: best practice = one per function
- ✅ Presentation is on **May $\mathbf{16^{th}}$** with 80-90\% of project complete.
